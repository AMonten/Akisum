# Akisum – Reverse Music Guessing Game

This is a Next.js application for Akisum, a competitive audio-based game where one player records a short music fragment, the system reverses it, and another player must imitate the reversed audio to guess the original song.

This project is built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI. It utilizes the Web Audio API for in-browser audio recording.
