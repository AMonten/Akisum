## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) to give a modern and engaging feel, evoking energy and focus required for the game.
- Background color: Dark Slate Gray (#2F4F4F), offering a contrasting dark theme that makes the bright electric blue pop, ensuring a visually appealing interface.
- Accent color: Hot Pink (#FF69B4) as an accent to highlight interactive elements, such as call-to-action buttons, providing clear visual cues for user interaction.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif font, will be used for headings and key information to make important information pop.
- Font: 'Inter' for the body of the text because of its neutral, easily readable design that makes it suitable for instructions and other supporting details.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent audio controls (play, pause, record) and game actions (add point, give up).
- A clean and intuitive layout with a focus on ease of use, ensuring the audio controls and game information are readily accessible.
- Subtle animations such as audio wave visualizations or smooth transitions between game states to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
